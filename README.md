# Custom CSS in Chrome

An extension for Google Chrome to add custom CSS on websites.

**Secure.** The extension does not require permissions to access all data on all websites all the time. Once you start editing CSS on a page, you get a permission prompt specific to that domain.

Later, if the CSS for a domain is not used, the permission will be dropped.

**Minimal.** There are no UI clutter of any kind. The entire extension consists of a big editable area for CSS code for the current domain.
